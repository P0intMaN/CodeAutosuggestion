# Sample Repo Data

- All the data collected from **GitHub** will fall in this **`repo`** folder.
- Data (repositories specifically) has been gathered by querying through the **GitHub API**.
- Repositories has been thoroughly cleaned and only `.py` files extracted.
 
 > _**`NOTE:`** This repo folder only holds a very marginal amount **(close to 0.0001%)** of repositories used to train **`PyAutoCode`** mode. The purpose of this sample repo folder is to provide you with an idea about how I colleted the data from GitHub and cleaned it. You may wish to use this as a reference if you'd like to._
